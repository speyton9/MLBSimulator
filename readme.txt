This is a MLB simulator I created. It will take the stats from players in the starting lineups and sim each game 250-3500 times depending on the number of 
teams playing. The Stats.csv is the input file, please note you will have to include Bullpen Stats for each team as well as a "Ghost" player for each team missing
a player from the starting 9. I have also provided the output file under MLBsim.csv.
